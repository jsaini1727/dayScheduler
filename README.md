# Day Scheduler
A day scheduler so that the user is on top of everything, every task, every day.

## Description
```
This was a great challenge. More so due to the fact that it was being completed during the holiday season. There were concepts that was explained remotely but thanks to the clarity of those explanations that I was able to accomplish this.  Now you can organize your self daily and have no reason to miss out the important things for the day. As for my journey to reach Mars, well I experience weightlessness for the first time and it was fun. I was scared but now that I have experienced it, the journey continues ......
